# Incite

## What is Incite?
Incite is a wrapper of popular Java data related frameworks. It aims to provide easier access of these technologies for 
non-developers (i.e. Business analysis) in one organization.

As of now, the following frameworks are embedded into Incite,
* Apache Camel (A well known enterprise integration framework)
* Apache Incite (A well known in memory database which can also serve as a compute/message grid)
* Apache Spark (A well known framework for data analytic & machine learning)

![Component diagram](component_diagram.png)

Currently, it provides the following features,

* Data [streaming] aggregation
* Enterprise integration 
* Hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP) SQL database
* Machine Learning

## Data [streaming] aggregation
Data aggregation is to compile and combine data from different data-sources for different kind of data-processing. 
Incite provides RESTful APIs which allow users to define and run data aggregation against multiple origins (sources) 
and write the result of the aggregation to different destinations (sinks). Not only that, Incite supports streaming 
aggregation as it supports streaming read and streaming write from/to different data-sources.

#### Supported sources
* JDBC (Non-streaming)
* Kafka (Non-Streaming & Streaming)

#### Supported sinks
* Embedded Ignite (Non-streaming)
* Ignite (Non-streaming)
* JDBC (Non-streaming)
* Kafka (Non-streaming & Streaming)

### RESTful API

* Create (the definition of) an aggregate task
* Start a defined aggregate task

## Enterprise integration
Enterprise integration allow data/message generated by different system to be integrated and processed to be further 
processed or to be shared. This functionality of Incite is powered by Apache Camel. Incite provides RESTful APIs which 
allow users to define an integration route written in Apache Camel's YAML DSL to ingest data from other systems and to 
egress the processed data to other systems or databases. 

### RESTful API

* Create route (, which will start the route if creation is successful.)
* Delete a running route (, which will stop the route if the route is running.)
* Resume a route
* Start a route
* Stop a route
* Suspend a route
* Update a defined route (, which will stop the route if the route is running and restart it after updating.)

## HTAP SQL database
Incite is powered by Apache Ignite which is also a hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP) SQL database. 
This means that Incite is friendly to both analytical & transactional workload. One does not have to transfer data 
stored by transactional operations to a standalone data warehouse to be analysed which saves resources and time.

```properties
## Example SpringBoot configuration
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.apache.ignite.IgniteJdbcThinDriver
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:ignite:thin://${incite.host}:${incite.port}/incite?lazy=true
spring.datasource.username=${incite.username}
spring.datasource.password=${incite.password}
```

## Machine Learning (ML)
Machine learning (ML) is a set of algorithms which provides insight of data. They can improve itself through the use of 
data. Incite provides RESTful API to define an ML job. Saved ML job can be triggered by RESTful API. Furthermore,
Incite also provide SQL functions to run machine learning algorithms against data stored on incite by using SQL query.
Currently, Incite only supports the following ML algorithms.

#### Classification
Supported algorithm:
* Logistic Regression

#### Clustering
Supported algorithm:
* Bisecting k-means
* K-means

### RESTful API

As mentioned, Incite provides a set of API for ML related operations. These APIs allow one to define an ML task on 
which data sources to build model from and the data sinks to write the predictions to, to create a new model from the 
latest data in the data sources, to perform prediction with the given JSON input/SQL query (, which will be used to 
retrieve the data from Incite for prediction).

#### Classification
* Create (the definition of) a classification task
* Build a model for a defined classification task
* Run a defined classification task with the latest model

#### Clustering
* Create (the definition of) a clustering task
* Build a model for a defined clustering task
* Run a defined clustering task with the latest model

### SQL functions

#### Classification
```roomsql
-- Build a model for a Classification entity stored to Incite
select build_classification_model('58b1a40f-571d-4b85-8b31-65cee8d9f9a2');
-- Return the UUID of the built model

-- Perform prediction for the given Classification entity with the given sql query and write the result to the sinks
-- defined in the Classification entity.
select classification_predict('58b1a40f-571d-4b85-8b31-65cee8d9f9a2', 'select * from sample_dataset');
-- Return the result in JSON format

-- Build a logistic regression model without creating a Classification entity
select build_logistic_regression_model('select * from sample_dataset', 'Multinomial', 'age,sex', 'result', 0.8, 1, 0.3);
--

-- Perform prediction with the logistic regression model from above and write the result to the given table. (Due to 
-- the nature of Apache Ignite, a primary key column need to be specified)
select logistic_regression_predict('548393d6-df18-4b4f-a24e-895a6bb86d26', 'select nr.id, nr.age, nr.sex from newly_registered nr', 'resultTable', 'id');
--
```

#### Clustering
```roomsql
-- Build a model for a Clustering entity stored to Incite
select build_clustering_model('2036cd45-557e-41ce-a157-e64253295032');
-- Return the UUID of the built model

-- Perform prediction for the given Clustering entity and given sql query
select clustering_predict('2036cd45-557e-41ce-a157-e64253295032', 'select * from sample_dataset');
-- Return the result in JSON format

-- Build a bisecting k-means model without creating a Clustering entity
select build_bisecting_k_means_model('select g.id, g.age, g.sex from guest g', 'age,sex', 4, 10, 1);
-- Return the UUID of the built model

-- Perform prediction with the bisecting k-means model from above and write the result to the given table. (Due to 
-- the nature of Apache Ignite, a primary key column need to be specified)
select bisecting_k_means_predict('526d6e09-5c13-486f-951a-5dad58e3d36c', 'select nr.id, nr.age, nr.sex from newly_registered nr', 'resultTable', 'id');
-- Return the result in JSON format
